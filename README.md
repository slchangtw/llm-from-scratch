# LLM from Scratch

This repository aims to streamline the setup of the execution environment on Google Colab for running the code from [LLM from Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch). The notebooks are derived from the book and include my own notes, while the original notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch).
